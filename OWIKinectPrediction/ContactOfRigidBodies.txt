Q: [1] assumes the impulse of the force between colliding bodies is perpendicular to the body face in vertex-face collision
and there is no friction related component along the face. Are these assumptions reasonable?






The following equations and assumptions are used to find the velocities of the bodies after the collision:
- conservation of the linear [1], [2, collision];
- conservation of the angular momentums [1];
- conservation of kinetic energy [2, collision]
- the impulse m*dv is orthogonal to the surface of one of the bodies, ([1], 8-7);
- V_after = restitution_coeff*V_before , where V_before and V_after are the relative velocities of the bodies before and after the collision [1, (8-10)];
