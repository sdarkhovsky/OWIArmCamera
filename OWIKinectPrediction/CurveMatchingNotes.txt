Instead of calculating curvatures locally as in Differential Geometry we should calculate non-local statistic, describing 
the curvature of the global curve shape. Maybe by inscribing a circle to a largest nbhd, which still has error per circle length ratio within a tolerance.

An online algorithm for matching noisy space curves with statistical error analysis, by Hyuntae Na

Algorithm 1 [1,2]
- smooth the curves with FFT
- run Douglas-Peucker algorithm to partition the curves as sequence of segments.
  The general idea is to detect contour regions having high a curvature toward the overall shape trend.
  Q:Not clear how references points are found by FMM and how they are used?
- describe each segment using Point Context descriptor and Contour Segment Shape Descriptor.
- use Hangarian method to find segment pairing of the minimal distance between segment descriptors

There must be a statistic generalizing the curvature for the corner points, so that how sharply the curve turns is expressed in the statistic.

Algorithm 2 [1], p.2
Step A: represent every curve by a sequence of its approximate local curvatures at given sample points
    Smoothing procedure: expand the noisy curve to a narrow strip defined by a certain threshold value eps and then finds the shortest path lying in
    this 2*eps-wide strip. This gives a polygonal approximation of each observed curve.
    Curvature k(s) is the derivative of the tangent angle teta(s) to the curve, which is parametrized as a function of its arclength.
    
Step B: Find the longest common substring of the two characteristic strings
  Find the longest matching substring between these two strings using Weiner's algorithm[1, p.7],[2]
  For a given K use the algorithm of Karp, Miller and Rosenberg (see [3]) to find the K longest matching substrings between the two characteristic
  strings. [1,p.8]
  Or sorting string of curvatures by value and matching the substring starting with similar curvature values maintaing an accumulator of hits proportional 
  to the length of the matching substrings.
Step C: find rotation/translation for the matched subcurves.

Algorithm 3
See C:\Users\Sam\Downloads\CurveMatching\Curvature Scale Space

- Convolve each of curve coordinates with a Gaussian function, while increasing the width of the Gaussian kernel, 
  to build the curvature scale space (CSS) k(u, sigma), where u is curve parameter, sigma is the Gaussian parameter, 
- find zero crossings of the curvature at different scales, which are (u,sigma) such that the curvature k(u,sigma)=0,
  thus constructing "CSS image"
- Following the "CSS image" maxima extraction ((u,sigma) where sigma is maximal), the CSS matching algorithm compares 
  two sets of maxima and assigns a matching value to them.

Comment: curves with straight line parts have a lot of curvature zero-crossing, which makes the zero-crossing statistic doubtful

Algorithm 5

The osculating plane of a curve varies from point to point and induces a homography between the views of the same curve.

In the short baseline case:
- for an edge point (edgel)x  of the contour chain c1 find the epipolar line on the second image l2=F*x;
- find the point x2 on the epipolar line l2 which is on the matched edge and which neighbourhood best correlates with the neighbourhood of x;

In the wide (large) baseline case:
- calculate curvatures of the corresponding curves;
- calculate osculating planes (using previously calculated curvatures to remove ambiguities) and homographies for each point of the curves;
- calculate the neighbourhood cross-correlation of corresponding points;

Algorithm 6

The algorithm looks for vector fields u(x,t) and reparametrization eta(s) which define deformations of the curve A  at t=0 to match the curbe B at t=1.
t is the parameter of morphing, s is the parameter of the curve.
The solution is found as a minimum of a functional defined on the vector fields u(x,t)

Algorithm 7

Frechet distance D(f,g) between curves f and g is defined as 
D(f,g)=inf (by alpha, beta) max(by t) Dp(f(alpha(t)),g(beta(t))), where alpha, beta are reprametrization of the curves, 0<=t<=1, 
Dp is distance under Lp norm
The algorithm does not consider matching when one curve is a rotation and/or translation of another curve.

Algorithm 8

A shape descriptor is calculated for each point of a shape. It describes a coarse distribution of the rest of the shape with respect to a given point.
Example of a possible shape descriptor is the ordered set of vectors originating at a shape point to all other points on a shape.
Rather than using a set of vectors, the algorithm calculates a histogram describing the distribution of the vectors.
Hi(k) = # {Q != Pi: Q-Pi is at the bin(k) }
The histogram is defined to be the shape context of Pi. The vectors are considered in the log-polar space.
Chi-square statistic is used to compare the histograms: C(Pi,Qj) = 1/2*sum(k=1,K,(Hi(k)-Hj(k))^2/(Hi(k)+Hj(k)))
In addition to the shape context the cost C(Pi,Qi) can include the local appearance similarity statistics, such as 
correlation score between patches surrounding Pi and Qj.
The assignment (bipartite matching) problem to find a permutation {Pi}=>{Qj} can be solved by the Hungarian or other methods.
The authors use the deterministic annealing for the bipartite matching.
Annealing is a process of first heating then cooling a system with attempt to bring it to the lower energy state [2]
Simulated annealing simulates the annealing process of an interconnected system of nodes, each of which can have states +1, -1.
Deterministic annealing [2] allows a node state to take an analog value -1 <= s <=1 rather than just -1 and +1.
After finding the correspondences (Pi,Qj), they are used to calculate Thin Plate Spline model, extending the transformation of 
the shape points to arbitrary points.
A set of prototype objects is used to classify a shape object using the nearest neighbour classifier.

Algorithm 9

- Contours of objects are extracted and extracted from the image and syntactic representation is contructed whose primitives 
  are line segments and whose attribites are length and absolute orientation.
- Let A = {a1,..an}, A' = {a1',...an'} be two sintactic representations of two contours, cyclically ordered lists of line segments.
- select candidates {ai, a'j} for a starting point of matching sequence (algorithm).
- use edit operations to extend the correspondence between the remaining unmatched segments, preserving their cyclic order. 
  The total cost is minimized using dynamic programming.
The algorithm searches for the starting match {ai,a'j}, which correspondence list has minimal edit cost.

Algorithm 10

Structural theories for object perception: an object can be decomposed and described as a configuration of atomic parts:
generalized cylinders[3],[4], Recognition by Components Theory [2], superquadrics [5]

Suggested primitives: edgels [6], contour segments [7],[9], or statistical descriptors of local or semi-local contours 
such as Shape Context [8].

A pair of boundary edges p and q from the boundary C will be referred to as a chord. 
We can think of a chord as a way to express a dependency between edges p and q.
We define features describing the geometry of the chord:
- Length l_pq and orientation  psi_pq of the vector p->q.
- Normalized normals teta_p and teta_q to the boundary at p and q with respect to the chord orientation  psi_pq
Thus, the chord features can be written as a four-tuple: f_pq = (l_pq;  psi_pq; teta_p; teta_q)'

The chordiogram ch_bs_ij is created from only one chord f_ij, calculated between points/edges i, j of the shape s, 
using binning scheme b.

The chordiogram (denoted by ch) is defined as a K-dimensional histogram of all chords, where chord features are quan-
tized into bins and the mth chordiogram element is given by: chm(C) = #{(p; q) | p; q are in C; f_pq is in bin(m)}
A holistic representation is when each object part is captured in the context of the whole object.
Nested binning schemes are used (instead of scale pyramid?) [10] 
The real linear programming problem is solved by ...?
The linear integer programming problem can be solved exactly using Max-Flow estimation algorithms.

Every object is representable as a set of segments. Every object boundary is representable as a set of segment boundaries.
A superpixel is an image patch which is better aligned with intensity edges than a rectangular patch [11]

To obtain superpixels we oversegment the image using NCuts with n = 45 segments [12].

The proposed curve signature is the integral of (absolute) curvature. The signature is invariant to the similarity transformations.

Algorithm

Paths of minimal Euclidian distance between two points on a surface are usually referred to as minimal geodesics [2]
Geodesics are locally shortest paths in the sense that any perturbation of a geodesic curve will increase its length.
The minimal length paths between two points are the minimal geodesics connecting thos points [2].

Our approach is based on the computation of the set of paths connecting the two curves to be matched. It minimizes
a cost function which measures the local similarity of the two curves. These matching paths are obtained as
geodesic curves on this cost surface [3].

In this paper, we develop a new method for pointwise tracking of structures by matching their contours. Hence, the deformation 
between two temporal occurrences will be obtained through a set of trajectories provided by the matching process. 
Our method is based on the computation of a set of paths connecting the two curves to be matched.
Each path minimize a cost function which measures the local similarity between the starting and ending points of the path. [3]  

The cost function is defined through a graph surface and measures, as we previously explained, the similarity between
the source and destination areas. This surface is the graph surface on which the connecting paths are computed [3]

The source and destination areas are defined as level sets of two bivariate functions phi0(x,y)=0 and psi0(x,y)=0 [3].

The problem of a source 3d curve's propagation to superimpose on a destination 3d curve is replaced by propagation of the curve's 
projection on (x,y) plane. The (x,y) plane curves are then considered as zero-level sets of a function phi(x,y) = 0.
If the curve is alpha(s)=(x(s),y(s)), then alpha(s)=phi^(-1)(0) (see [3],(4)), phi: R2->R1 or (x,y)->z.
phi(alpha(s))

Algorithm

The algorithm approximates the optimal relative matching between two curves based on differential properties of the curves.
Freeform surface means not having rigid radial dimensions, unlike regular surfaces such as planes, cylinders and conic surfaces [2].
Freeform curves and surfaces are those whose shapes are more complicated and not describable using common terms like "circular" or "parabolic" [3].

Algorithm

The algorithm prefers to work with an edge map, which only consists of closed contours to begin with.
A shape descriptor used by the algorithm is the sequence of tangent angles.
Each of matched shapes is represented as N arclength parameters (ui <--> vj)
The probability that two points match can be decomposed into two components,
one for their similarity, and one for the local stretch of the curve:

Elsewhere an object class is represented by a collection of smaller visual stimuli, either linked by a
confiuration model ("part-based models") [8,36], or without using the relative position information ("bag-of-features models") [25,40].

Algorithm

Other approaches convert the curves to strings of points and use the dynamic programming for string-to-string correction algorithm to find 
a match with the shortest edit distance.
To find a true continuous solution of a discretized problem of matching two curves, the FMM assigns an underlying differential equation 
to the problem. (There are other ways to extend the problem to the continuous domain, for example, the curve reconstruction by 
convolution with the Gaussian or the sinc kernels).

Algorithm

Detection [1,ch.4]: 
1. the edges are detected
2. the boundary fragments of the weak detectors are matched to this edge image;
3. a weak detector h fires if [1,ch.3.1]:
   - the k boundary fragments match image edge chains 
   - the centroid estimates concur
   - D(h,I) < threshold
4. the strong detector 
  the firing weak detector votes with the weight w_h on the centroid location in a Hough voting space

A scaled codebook representation is used. [1,ch.6]
The Mean-Shift modes are then aggregated over the set of scales, and the maxima explored as in the single scale case.  
To achieve in-plane rotation invariance we use rotated versions of the codebook.
  

Q: Are the locations of the boundary fragment detectors forming a weak detector fixed with respect to an image or to each other? [1, ch.3.1]
A: The locations of the boundary fragment detectors forming a weak detector are not fixed with respect to each other and to an image[1, fig.6b]

Distance between a weak detector and an image sums up distances from each component boundary fragment detector [1,(3)], which in turn sums up 
distanced between a boundary fragment and a best matching image chain [1,(2)]

Fragment detectors forming a weak detector fire only if they both vote for the same centroid. [1, fig.6 and ch.3.1]
Distance of a fragment gamma to an image is calculated in [1,(2)] using the chamfer distance [6]. An alternative to the chamfer distance could be Hausdorff distance)
Each boundary fragment gamma of a weak detector is matched separately and only those for which distance(gamma, image) < threshold are used.[1,p.7]
Boundary fragments centroids of a weak detector are close.
Weak detectors sharing a centroid  vote for the centroid with a weight, and generate the vote of a strong detector.
When the strong detector detected an object , its weak detectors vote for the centroid [1,p.9, Probabilistic scoring]
The votes are considered as values of a probability distribution.
The mean-shift is used to find modes (maximums) of the distributions.

Mean shift is a non-parametric feature-space analysis technique for locating the maxima of a density function, a so-called mode-seeking algorithm[7].
The mean shift mode is used to find objects' centroids.[1,ch.4,p.8]
All parts vote on the object centroid as in a Generalized Hough transform[1].

Notes

A curve should be recognized if a characteristic (containing enough information for the purpose) part of it is visible.
The part doesn't have to be a (continuous) connected set, i.e. itself be formed from multiple parts.
Each part constitute a relation. Then compound relation is described by location and orientation of the component 
relations in a reference frame of the compound relation.
Suppose during detection each component is detected separately at certain location and orientation.
Q: How the location, orientation, scale of the components can be effectively used to detect the compound?

Consider first the case when only locations of the components are analyzed.
Definition 1: The compound relation (or just compound) is defined by {(relation_i,rel_certainty_i,location_i), i=1,N}.  

Q1.: How to detect a compound in another compound?
Q2.: How to select compounds useful for object detection.
   Assumptions:
    - the description of an object includes one or more compound relations;
    - the scene is a compound;
    - an object's compound may be present partially (not all component relations) in the scene, but the present part satisfies 
      the compound's constraints.
    - locations of component relations within compound may change in the scene if an object consists of component objects, 
      which can move with respect to each other.

Consider Q1 and Q2 in case of 3d edges, when the location from R3 and the components can be parametrized by 1d arc length parameter
or even simpler in case of 2d edges of handwritten English alphabet characters.
Dynamic programming kind of algorithm detecting an ordered compound {(x0i,x1i), i=0,N-1} in a compound {(y0i,y1i),i=0,M-1}
- match each segment ((x0i, x1i), (x(0,i+1), x(1,i+1))) to set of segments of about the same length of the scene {((y0i, y1i), (y(0,i+1), y(1,i+1))}
- grow each segment ((x0i, x1i), (x(0,i+1), x(1,i+1)) to 3-length segment ((x0i, x1i), (x(0,i+1), x(1,i+1)), (x(0,i+2), x(1,i+2))), looking for
  matching candidates among the set of 2-length scene cadidates;
- repeat the growing step by growing k-length segment of the compound and looking for matching candidates among the set of k-length scene cadidates; k = k+1
